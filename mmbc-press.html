  <p>
    When the Mersey Motor Boat Club began fundraising for the North West Air Ambulance,
    one of the youngest supporters decided to join in — <strong>six-year-old Lily
    Whitehead</strong>, granddaughter of the club’s Commodore, <strong>David Whitehead</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lily, who attends <strong>Wellfield Methodist and Anglican School</strong> in Burnley,
    took part in the <strong>York Kids Fun Triathlon</strong> and completed it in
    <strong>14 minutes and 16 seconds</strong>, raising an exact total of
    <strong>£750</strong> for the charity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her challenge included swimming, cycling and running, with support from her family
    and encouragement from MMBC members who sponsored her effort. The funds Lily raised
    contributed directly to the club’s overall total of more than £3,000, presented this
    month to the North West Air Ambulance.
  </p>

  <p>
    “<em>She just wanted to help her granddad</em>,” said Commodore David Whitehead.
    “<em>Both her mum and dad are paramedics, so she knows how important the Air Ambulance
    is — she wanted to do her bit.</em>”

  <p>
    Members and guests of the Mersey Motor Boat Club came together for their
    annual <strong>Black Tie Dinner</strong> — and turned it into a celebration of community
    fundraising, presenting the
    <a href="https://nwaa.net" target="_blank">North West Air Ambulance Charity</a>
    with a cheque for <strong>£3,231</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The evening included a three-course meal, live music from
    <strong>Gemma Louise Doyle</strong>, and a heartfelt presentation to NWAA representative
    <strong>Anne</strong>, who thanked the club and described how each donation keeps the
    service running 365 days a year.
  </p>

  <p>
    “<em>We basically bring the hospital to the roadside</em>,” Anne explained.
    “<em>We have blood on board and a critical care team — often a consultant-level doctor
    or senior paramedic — so we can perform life-saving treatment at the scene.</em>”
  </p>

  <p>
    She also encouraged ongoing support through NWAA’s
    <a href="https://nwaa.net/lottery/" target="_blank">Lift Off Lottery</a>,
    online donations, legacy gifts, and their network of charity shops.
    “<em>Every penny donated keeps us flying.</em>”

    MMBC’s committee thanked members, families and friends for their generosity
    throughout the year — including Lily’s mini-triathlon challenge — which helped
    the club exceed its original fundraising target.
